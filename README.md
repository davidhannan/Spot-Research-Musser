# Spot-Research-Musser

Spot is not currently available for me to use since I am not in Columbia this semester. Because of this, this repo is focused more on learning and applying the use of GRPC and computer vision.


Most of my work here is done in [this](https://github.com/davidhannan/Spot-Research-Musser/tree/main/code/grpc-camera-pi) directory.
